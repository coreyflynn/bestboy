# Best Boy
## Install
```
npm i -g bestboy
```

## Usage
Best Boy invoked with no arguments will prompt you for a location for the feature it will create.
```
bestboy
```

Best Boy invoked with a path will skip the prompt.

Once given a path, bestboy will create a folder for the feature if needed and then prompt you
for which parts of the feature you need.
